# Veloria Fashion Store — Project overview

Veloria Fashion Store is the working name we've agreed for the group's fashion house. This README is a brief, high-level overview so we can start planning before writing code.

What this repo will hold (high level)
- A small multi-page marketing site: Home, Products, Board (team), Events, and Inquiries (contact/appointments).
- Shared assets: styles in `assets/css/`, scripts in `assets/js/`, and images in `assets/images/`.

Goals for the first iteration
- Agree on the project name and link structure (done).
- Create basic, static pages with consistent header/footer and a simple marquee area for announcements.
- Keep styling in one external file: `assets/css/style.css`.
- Add a small `assets/js/main.js` later to handle the marquee and tiny enhancements (no heavy JS yet).

Minimal recommended file layout

- `index.html` — Home / hero / short product highlights
- `products.html` — Product listing (static for now)
- `board.html` — Photos + short bios of group members
- `events.html` — Upcoming events (simple list)
- `inquiries.html` — Contact form / appointment request
- `assets/css/style.css` — External stylesheet
- `assets/js/main.js` — Small common scripts (marquee, mobile nav)

Next steps (small and simple)
1. Decide which pages to create first (I recommend `index.html` + `board.html`).
2. Add minimal placeholder content and a shared header with nav and a marquee container.
3. Add a single `style.css` and a tiny `main.js` that injects text for the marquee.

If you'd like, I can create the minimal starter pages and the two asset files now (placeholders only). Tell me which pages you want first or say "all starter pages" and I'll generate them.

Created for the Veloria Fashion Store project — a concise roadmap to get started.
